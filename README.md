## 📚 Documentation

- **Project Architecture**: Detailed modular structure for deep learning pipelines.
- **Model Reference**: CNN-based classification for medical imaging.
- **API Reference**: How to integrate the classification engine into web apps.

## ❓ Why use this Project?

This project helps developers build production-ready Medical AI applications through a standard interface for image processing and model inference:

- **Real-time Prediction**: Easily connect the model to medical databases for instant X-ray analysis.
- **Model Interoperability**: Swap different CNN architectures (ResNet, VGG) easily thanks to modular coding.
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Build and test new disease classification models without rebuilding the entire pipeline.
- **Production-ready Features**: Built-in support for monitoring and evaluation through MLOps workflows.

## 🏗️ Project Ecosystem

Paired with this project, you can use:
- **MLflow**: For tracking experiments and model versions.
- **DVC**: To manage large medical image datasets.
- **Docker**: For containerized deployment in hospitals.
